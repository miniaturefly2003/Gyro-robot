Gesture-controlled RC cars, also known as remote-controlled cars, are vehicles that can be operated and controlled using hand gestures or body motions instead of 
traditional joystick-based controls. These cars leverage advanced sensor technologies and gesture recognition algorithms to interpret human gestures and translate 
them into vehicle commands.
